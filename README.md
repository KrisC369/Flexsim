GridFlex Simulator
=======

A project for experiments on flexibility-representation and energy aggregation functionality in industrial settings.
This project contains the core components for building an electrical grid representation with TSO, an energy aggregator, production sites and production processes with workstations and resource buffers. 
This project is also used for experiments using game theoretic abstractions. E.g. analyzing strategic choice of prosumers between multiple aggregators.
This software is used in support of a research project analysing decision making in smart-grid contexts.

This project is in no way or form affiliated with FlexSim Software Products, Inc and will in the very near future be rebranded to avoid further confusion.
