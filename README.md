Flexsim
=======

A project for experiments on flexibility-representation and energy aggregation functionality in industrial factory settings.
This project contains the core components for building an electrical grid representation with TSO, an energy aggregator, production sites and production processes with workstations and resource buffers. 

Examples on how to use these models to build and run simulations can be found in a different github project called [FlexExp](https://github.com/KrisC369/FlexExp.git).
